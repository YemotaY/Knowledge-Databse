# Knowledge-Databse
This project will grow into an full sized tech handbook, maybe one day. Starting with transistors and capacitors, to assemblers until finally the modern languages and Hardware.

This should cover both, hard and software but my focus (and also passion) is more on software. But the deep understanding of Hardware is often required.
