# Diodes

## Overview
Diodes are semiconductor devices that allow current to flow in only one direction. They are the simplest semiconductor devices and form the basis for more complex components.

## Basic Function
- **One-Way Current Flow**: Current flows from anode to cathode
- **Voltage Drop**: Typically 0.7V for silicon diodes
- **Rectification**: Converts AC to DC
- **Protection**: Prevents reverse current damage

## Types of Diodes

### Basic Diodes
- **Silicon Diodes**: Most common, 0.7V forward drop
- **Germanium Diodes**: Lower forward drop (0.3V), less common
- **Schottky Diodes**: Fast switching, low forward drop

### Special Purpose Diodes
- **Zener Diodes**: Voltage regulation, controlled reverse breakdown
- **Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)**: Convert electrical energy to light
- **Photodiodes**: Convert light to electrical current
- **Varactor Diodes**: Voltage-controlled capacitance

## Forward and Reverse Bias
### Forward Bias
- Anode positive relative to cathode
- Current flows freely (after threshold voltage)
- Low resistance

### Reverse Bias
- Cathode positive relative to anode
- No current flow (ideally)
- High resistance until breakdown voltage

## Key Parameters
- **Forward Voltage Drop (Vf)**: Voltage across diode when conducting
- **Reverse Breakdown Voltage**: Maximum reverse voltage before breakdown
- **Forward Current (If)**: Maximum continuous forward current
- **Reverse Recovery Time**: Switching speed characteristic

## Applications in Digital Systems

### Power Supply Circuits
- **Rectification**: Converting AC to DC
- **Voltage Regulation**: Using zener diodes
- **Polarity Protection**: Preventing reverse voltage damage

### Logic Circuits
- **Clamping**: Limiting voltage levels
- **OR Gates**: Using diode logic
- **Signal Isolation**: Preventing current backflow

### Protection Circuits
- **ESD Protection**: Protecting sensitive components
- **Flyback Diodes**: Protecting against inductive spikes
- **Overvoltage Protection**: Using TVS diodes

## LED Characteristics
- **Colors**: Determined by semiconductor material
- **Forward Voltage**: Varies by color (1.8V-3.5V)
- **Current Limiting**: Always use with current-limiting resistor
- **Efficiency**: High efficiency compared to incandescent bulbs

## Practical Considerations
- **Heat Dissipation**: Power = Vf Ã— If
- **Switching Speed**: Important for high-frequency applications
- **Temperature Effects**: Forward voltage decreases with temperature
- **Reverse Leakage**: Small current even when reverse biased

## Testing Diodes
- **Multimeter**: Should show low resistance forward, high reverse
- **In-Circuit**: May need to disconnect one lead
- **LED Test**: Should light up with small forward current
