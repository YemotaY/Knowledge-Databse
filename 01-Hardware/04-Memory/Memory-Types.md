# Memory Types

## Overview
Computer memory systems use various technologies to store data, each with different characteristics in terms of speed, capacity, power consumption, and cost. Understanding these trade-offs is crucial for system design.

## Memory Hierarchy
The memory hierarchy organizes different memory types by speed and capacity:

1. **CPU Registers**: Fastest, smallest capacity
2. **Cache Memory**: Very fast, small to medium capacity  
3. **Main Memory (RAM)**: Fast, large capacity
4. **Storage (SSD/HDD)**: Slower, very large capacity
5. **Archival Storage**: Slowest, massive capacity

## Static RAM (SRAM)

### Structure and Operation
- **Cell Design**: 6 transistors per bit (6T cell)
- **Storage Method**: Uses flip-flop circuit to maintain state
- **Stability**: Retains data as long as power is applied
- **No Refresh**: Data doesn't need periodic refreshing

### Characteristics
- **Speed**: Very fast access times (0.5-5 ns)
- **Power**: Low power when idle, higher when active
- **Density**: Lower density due to 6 transistors per bit
- **Cost**: Expensive per bit compared to DRAM

### Applications
- **CPU Caches**: L1, L2, L3 caches
- **Register Files**: Fast storage in processors
- **Buffer Memory**: High-speed temporary storage
- **Embedded Systems**: Where speed is critical

## Dynamic RAM (DRAM)

### Structure and Operation
- **Cell Design**: 1 transistor + 1 capacitor per bit (1T1C)
- **Storage Method**: Charge stored on capacitor
- **Refresh Required**: Capacitor leaks, needs periodic refresh
- **Destructive Read**: Reading destroys data, must be rewritten

### Characteristics
- **Speed**: Slower than SRAM (10-50 ns access time)
- **Density**: Higher density due to simple cell structure
- **Power**: Lower idle power, refresh power overhead
- **Cost**: Much cheaper per bit than SRAM

### DRAM Operations
- **Row Access Strobe (RAS)**: Selects row in memory array
- **Column Access Strobe (CAS)**: Selects column in selected row
- **Precharge**: Prepares bitlines for next access
- **Refresh**: Periodic rewrite to maintain data integrity
