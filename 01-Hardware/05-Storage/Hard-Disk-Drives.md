## Overview
Hard Disk Drives are traditional mechanical storage devices that use rotating magnetic disks (platters) and read/write heads to store and retrieve data. While largely superseded by SSDs for primary storage, HDDs remain important for bulk storage due to their cost per gigabyte advantage.

## Physical Construction

### Platters
- **Material**: Aluminum or glass substrate with magnetic coating
- **Size**: 3.5" (desktop), 2.5" (laptop), 1.8" (compact devices)
- **Coating**: Thin film magnetic material (typically cobalt alloy)
- **Tracks**: Concentric circles of data storage areas
- **Sectors**: Individual data storage units within tracks

### Read/Write Heads
- **Technology**: Magnetoresistive (MR) or Giant Magnetoresistive (GMR)
- **Operation**: Detect magnetic field changes as magnetic bits
- **Flying Height**: 3-5 nanometers above platter surface
- **Head Crash**: Catastrophic failure when head touches platter

### Actuator Arm
- **Function**: Positions read/write heads over correct track
- **Technology**: Voice coil motor (VCM) for precise positioning
- **Servo System**: Feedback control for accurate positioning
- **Access Time**: Time to move head to correct position

### Spindle Motor
- **Function**: Rotates platters at constant speed
- **Speeds**: 5,400, 7,200, 10,000, 15,000 RPM
- **Bearing**: Fluid dynamic bearing or ball bearing
- **Power Consumption**: Major power consumer in HDD

## Data Organization

### Cylinder-Head-Sector (CHS) Addressing
- **Cylinder**: All tracks at same position on multiple platters
- **Head**: Specific read/write head (top/bottom of each platter)
- **Sector**: Individual data block within track
- **Legacy**: Mostly replaced by LBA addressing

### Logical Block Addressing (LBA)
- **Sequential Numbering**: Sectors numbered 0, 1, 2, ...
- **Translation**: Drive controller maps LBA to physical CHS
- **Benefits**: Simplifies operating system interface
- **Modern Standard**: All modern drives use LBA

### Track and Sector Layout
**Traditional Sectors**:
- **512 bytes**: Historical standard sector size
- **Fixed Sectors**: Same number of sectors per track

**Advanced Format**:
