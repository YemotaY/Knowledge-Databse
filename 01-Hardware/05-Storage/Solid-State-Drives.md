## Overview
Solid State Drives use NAND flash memory to store data persistently without moving parts. They have largely replaced hard disk drives in many applications due to superior performance, reliability, and energy efficiency.

## NAND Flash Technology

### Memory Cell Types

## SSD Architecture

### Controller
**Functions**:
- **Flash Translation Layer (FTL)**: Maps logical to physical addresses
- **Wear Leveling**: Distributes writes evenly across flash
- **Garbage Collection**: Reclaims unused space
- **Error Correction**: Detects and corrects data errors
- **Interface Management**: Handles host communication

**Types**:
- **In-house Controllers**: Developed by SSD manufacturers
- **Third-party Controllers**: From specialized controller companies
- **CPU Cores**: ARM or proprietary processors

### Flash Translation Layer (FTL)
**Purpose**: Hide flash memory limitations from host system

**Key Functions**:
- **Address Mapping**: Logical Block Address (LBA) to Physical Block Address (PBA)
- **Bad Block Management**: Mark and avoid defective blocks
- **Wear Leveling**: Ensure even wear across all blocks
- **Garbage Collection**: Consolidate valid data and erase unused blocks

**Mapping Schemes**:
- **Page-level Mapping**: Fine-grained but memory intensive
- **Block-level Mapping**: Coarse-grained but memory efficient
- **Hybrid Mapping**: Combines both approaches

### Over-Provisioning
**Definition**: Extra NAND flash capacity not visible to host

**Benefits**:
- **Wear Leveling**: More blocks available for rotation
- **Garbage Collection**: Space for temporary operations
- **Bad Block Replacement**: Spare blocks for defective ones
- **Performance**: Maintains performance as drive fills up

**Typical Amounts**:
- **Consumer SSDs**: 7-15% over-provisioning
- **Enterprise SSDs**: 20-28% over-provisioning

## SSD Performance Characteristics

### Sequential Performance
**Read Performance**:
- **SATA SSDs**: Up to 550 MB/s
- **NVMe SSDs**: 1,000-7,000+ MB/s
- **Factors**: Interface bandwidth, controller capability

**Write Performance**:
- **SLC Cache**: Fast initial writes to pseudo-SLC
- **Direct-to-TLC/QLC**: Slower sustained writes
- **Cache Exhaustion**: Performance drops when cache fills

### Random Performance
**IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)**:
- **4K Random Read**: 10,000-500,000+ IOPS
- **4K Random Write**: 5,000-100,000+ IOPS
- **Queue Depth**: Performance scales with multiple outstanding commands

**Latency**:
- **Read Latency**: 10-100 microseconds
- **Write Latency**: 10-500 microseconds
- **Comparison**: Much lower than HDD (3-15 milliseconds)

### Performance Factors
**Temperature**:
- **Optimal Range**: 0-70¬∞C for most SSDs
- **Thermal Throttling**: Performance reduction when overheated
- **Data Retention**: Higher temperatures reduce retention time

**Workload Patterns**:
- **Sequential vs Random**: Sequential generally faster
- **Read vs Write**: Reads typically faster than writes
- **Queue Depth**: Higher queue depth improves throughput
- **Block Size**: Larger blocks improve sequential performance

## Wear Leveling Algorithms

### Static Wear Leveling
**Concept**: Move data from infrequently written blocks to frequently written blocks
**Goal**: Ensure all blocks wear evenly, including cold data

### Dynamic Wear Leveling
**Concept**: Distribute new writes across least-worn blocks
**Limitation**: Cold data blocks may not wear evenly

### Global Wear Leveling
**Advanced Approach**: Consider entire drive for optimal wear distribution
**Benefits**: Better long-term endurance and performance

## Garbage Collection

### Write Amplification
**Definition**: Ratio of actual NAND writes to host writes
**Causes**:
- Garbage collection overhead
- Over-provisioning inefficiency
- Small random writes
