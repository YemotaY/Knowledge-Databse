## Overview
Multi-core processors contain multiple processing cores on a single chip, enabling parallel execution of tasks and improved overall system performance. This architecture has become the standard for modern computing from smartphones to supercomputers.

## Evolution to Multi-Core

### Single-Core Limitations
**Power Wall**: Clock speeds hit practical limits due to power consumption
**Memory Wall**: Growing gap between processor and memory speeds
**Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP) Wall**: Diminishing returns from superscalar techniques
**Heat Dissipation**: Higher frequencies generate excessive heat

### Multi-Core Benefits
**Thread-Level Parallelism**: Execute multiple threads simultaneously
**Better Resource Utilization**: Cores can work on different tasks
**Power Efficiency**: Lower clock speeds with more cores
**Scalability**: Add cores instead of increasing frequency

## Core Architecture Types

### Homogeneous Multi-Core
**Identical Cores**: All cores have same architecture and capabilities
**Symmetric Processing**: Any core can handle any task
**Examples**: Intel Core series, AMD Ryzen
**Benefits**: Simplified programming model, balanced performance

### Heterogeneous Multi-Core (big.LITTLE / big.mid.LITTLE)
**Different Core Types**: Mix of high-performance and efficient cores
**Task Scheduling**: OS assigns tasks based on performance requirements
**Examples**: ARM big.LITTLE, Apple Silicon M-series
**Benefits**: Better power efficiency, optimized for different workloads

**big.LITTLE Architecture**:
- **Big Cores**: High-performance, out-of-order execution
- **LITTLE Cores**: Power-efficient, in-order execution
- **Migration**: Tasks move between core types based on demand
- **Cluster Switching**: Switch between core clusters

**Apple's Approach**:
- **Performance Cores**: Maximum single-thread performance
- **Efficiency Cores**: Background tasks and light workloads
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: macOS scheduler optimizes core usage
- **Unified Memory**: Shared memory architecture

## Cache Hierarchy in Multi-Core

### Private Caches
**L1 Cache**: Private to each core (instruction and data)
**L2 Cache**: May be private or shared depending on design
**Benefits**: No cache coherency issues for private data
**Drawbacks**: No sharing of cached data between cores

### Shared Caches
**L3 Cache**: Typically shared among all cores
**Benefits**: Efficient sharing of data between cores
**Challenges**: Cache coherency protocols required
**Victim Cache**: L3 may store data evicted from L2 caches

### Cache Coherency Protocols
**MESI Protocol** (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid):
- **Modified**: Cache line modified, not in other caches
- **Exclusive**: Cache line present only in this cache
- **Shared**: Cache line present in multiple caches
- **Invalid**: Cache line not valid

**MOESI Protocol**: Adds "Owned" state for optimization
**Directory-Based**: Scalable coherency for many cores
**Snooping**: Cores monitor bus for coherency

## Interconnect Technologies

### Bus-Based Interconnects
**Shared Bus**: All cores share single bus
**Limitations**: Bandwidth doesn't scale with core count
**Contention**: Performance degrades with more cores
**Legacy**: Used in early multi-core designs

### Point-to-Point Interconnects
**Dedicated Links**: Direct connections between components
**Scalability**: Bandwidth scales with components
**Examples**: Intel QPI/UPI, AMD Infinity Fabric
**Topology**: Various topologies (mesh, ring, crossbar)

### Network-on-Chip (NoC)
**Packet-Based**: Communication via packet switching
**Scalability**: Supports many cores efficiently
**Routing**: Adaptive routing for optimal paths
**Examples**: Intel's mesh interconnect, ARM CoreLink

## Parallel Programming Models

### Shared Memory Programming
**Threads**: Multiple execution contexts in same address space
**Synchronization**: Mutexes, semaphores, atomic operations
**APIs**: Pthreads, Windows threads, C++11 threads
**Challenges**: Race conditions, deadlocks, false sharing

### Message Passing
**Process-Based**: Separate address spaces communicate via messages
**APIs**: MPI (Message Passing Interface)
**Benefits**: No shared state issues
**Overhead**: Communication costs higher than shared memory

### Task-Based Programming
**Tasks**: Units of work that can execute in parallel
**Work Stealing**: Idle cores steal work from busy cores
**Examples**: Intel TBB, OpenMP tasks, Cilk Plus
**Benefits**: Dynamic load balancing, easier programming

### Data Parallel Programming
**SIMD Operations**: Same operation on multiple data elements
**Vector Instructions**: SSE, AVX, NEON
**Auto-Vectorization**: Compiler automatically parallelizes loops
**Examples**: Array operations, image processing

## Performance Considerations

### Amdahl's Law
**Formula**: Speedup = 1 / ((1-P) + P/N)
- P = Parallel portion of program
- N = Number of processors
**Implication**: Serial portion limits maximum speedup
**Reality**: Few programs are perfectly parallel

### Gustafson's Law
**Concept**: Problem size grows with available processors
**Formula**: Speedup = N - Œ±(N-1)
**Implication**: Larger problems can achieve better parallel efficiency
**Real-world**: More realistic for many applications

### Scalability Challenges
**False Sharing**: Cache line ping-ponging between cores
**Lock Contention**: Multiple threads waiting for same resource
**Load Imbalance**: Uneven work distribution among cores
**Memory Bandwidth**: Shared memory bandwidth limitation

## Threading and Synchronization

### Threading Models
**1:1 Model**: One kernel thread per user thread
**N:1 Model**: Many user threads to one kernel thread
**M:N Model**: Many user threads to many kernel threads
